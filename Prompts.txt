================================================================================
1. FILE UPLOAD - DATA EXTRACTION PROMPT (Groq/Gemini)
================================================================================

Extract energy prediction parameters from this text and return ONLY valid JSON.

Required fields (extract from text, use defaults if not found):
- DateTime: date and time in "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM" format (if date like "11-01-2026 10:30" found, convert to "2026-01-11T10:30")
- Temperature: number (remove any units like °C)
- Humidity: number 0-100 (remove any % symbols)
- SquareFootage: number (square footage or area)
- Occupancy: number 1-10 (number of people)
- RenewableEnergy: number (renewable energy in kWh)
- HVACUsage: must be exactly "On" or "Off" (convert "on" to "On", "off" to "Off")
- LightingUsage: must be exactly "On" or "Off" (also check for "Lightning Usage" typo - treat as Lighting)
- Holiday: must be exactly "Yes" or "No" (convert "yes" to "Yes", "no" to "No")

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Convert all text values to proper case: "on" → "On", "yes" → "Yes"
2. Handle typos: "Lightning" → "Lighting"
3. Convert date formats: "11-01-2026 10:30" → "2026-01-11T10:30"
4. Remove units: "29.2°C" → 29.2, "48.3%" → 48.3
5. If any field is missing, use these defaults:
   - Temperature: 22, Humidity: 50, SquareFootage: 1500, Occupancy: 3
   - RenewableEnergy: 5, HVACUsage: "Off", LightingUsage: "Off", Holiday: "No"

Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown, no explanations, no extra text.
