Smart Energy Consumption Analysis & Prediction

This project presents an intelligent energy prediction platform that combines Machine Learning and Generative AI to make energy analytics understandable and interactive.

The system predicts building energy consumption using operational parameters such as HVAC usage, occupancy, temperature, renewable energy contribution, time, and weekend patterns. Instead of only giving a numerical result, the application explains why consumption is high or low through an AI chatbot and an automatically generated audit report.

Users can provide inputs manually, through conversation, or by uploading documents and datasets. The platform also supports bulk prediction, voice interaction, and downloadable audit reports, making it useful for monitoring and optimizing energy usage.

Overall, the project demonstrates how AI can transform raw energy data into actionable insights, helping users understand behavior patterns and improve efficiency.
