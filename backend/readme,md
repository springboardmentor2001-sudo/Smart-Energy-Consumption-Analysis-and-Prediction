# ⚡ Energy Wastage Detection System

This project is a machine learning–based web application that predicts energy consumption and identifies potential energy wastage in buildings.  
It helps in understanding energy usage patterns and supports better energy management decisions.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Energy wastage in buildings often goes unnoticed due to lack of real-time analysis and prediction.  
Without intelligent systems, it becomes difficult to identify inefficient energy usage.

This project aims to solve that problem using **feature engineering** and **machine learning models**.

---

## 🚀 Solution Overview

- Perform feature engineering on raw energy data
- Train a machine learning model to predict energy consumption
- Deploy the trained model using a Flask web application
- Allow users to input parameters and get real-time predictions

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- Feature engineering for time-based and energy-related patterns
- Train-test data splitting
- Model training using LightGBM
- Model evaluation using R², MAE, and RMSE
- Model saved and loaded using Pickle

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **Machine Learning:** LightGBM, Scikit-learn  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Model Storage:** Pickle
