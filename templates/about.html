        <h2>🎯 How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            Our platform leverages a sophisticated LightGBM machine learning model, trained on extensive energy 
            consumption datasets to deliver precise predictions tailored to your unique situation. The system 
            intelligently analyzes multiple factors including:
        </p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>Environmental Conditions:</strong> Temperature and humidity levels</li>
            <li><strong>Building Characteristics:</strong> Square footage and structural properties</li>
            <li><strong>Occupancy Patterns:</strong> Number of people and usage timing</li>
            <li><strong>System Operations:</strong> HVAC and lighting usage status</li>
            <li><strong>Renewable Integration:</strong> Your renewable energy contributions</li>
            <li><strong>Temporal Factors:</strong> Time of day, day of week, and seasonal variations</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            The model automatically calculates advanced engineered features and time-based variables to enhance 
            prediction accuracy, ensuring you receive the most reliable energy consumption forecasts possible.

                <div class="suggestion-text">
                    Adjust your thermostat by 3-5°F when away from home. Every degree can save 3-5% on cooling 
                    and heating costs. Use programmable thermostats for automatic adjustments.

                <div class="suggestion-text">
                    Turn off HVAC systems when spaces are unoccupied. Regular maintenance and filter changes 
                    improve efficiency by up to 15%. Consider zoned heating/cooling for larger homes.
